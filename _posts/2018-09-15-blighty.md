After a long time away, I decided to visit the UK this Autumn. It was a refreshing trip, not least because I got to hang out with some of my dear old friends and colleagues, most of whom I got to know during my time at the Universities of Birmingham and Manchester.

The tour was packed with action, one could say. The itenerary went like so:

**Sheffield** &rarr; **London** &rarr; **Birmingham** &rarr; **Manchester** &rarr; **Bath and Bristol**. 

Looks like a band on tour? Perhaps a pub crawl? It was neither. Here is a run down of what transpired.

## Sheffield
Sheffield is transforming from being the yester city of steel, to becoming the city of [Rigorous Research](https://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/P.Oliveto/rig/), at least if you care about **Nature Inspired Computation**. Caught up with [an old friend and collaborator](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/P.Oliveto/), who happens to lead the aforementioned effort. Sheffield is, in fact, also the city with a solid **[Gaussian Processes](https://github.com/orgs/SheffieldML/people)** core! I had the pleasure of attending the [summer school](http://gpss.cc/gpss18/program) on the subject, organised by some old colleagues who used to hang out on the other side of the peaks in Manchester a few years ago. Something tells me we ought to put these two foundations of Sheffield together and automate the search for kernels for GPs at some point. Just a random thought.

## London
Imagine a weekend in London. Yes. One of those. I know there is high variance in London experiences. Let's just keep it mysterious, shall we! 

## Birmingham
Apart from some real ale, which **one must**, the company of [old friends/collaborators](https://www2.aston.ac.uk/eas/staff/a-z/dr-peter-lewis) in the city I *grew up* away from my first home, thus my *second home*, is always a special thing. Compared to back in the days as PhD students at [Bham](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/), it is somewhat of a luxury to just swing by and also get to give a **research seminar** at their research group. This happened at [ALICE](https://alice.aston.ac.uk/), the Aston Lab for Intelligent Collectives Engineering. It was a talk on deep reinforcement learning (deep RL), which is mostly what I talk about now-a-days. I got to meet some PhD students working/intending to work on the subject as well, which is always a refreshing exercise.

## Manchester
My home after Birmingham, thus my *third home*, in the company of [more](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/richard.allmendinger/default.htm) [friends](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/soiland-reyes.html), this was a similarly special visit like the one to Birmingham. Yet again, it was a pleasure to give a **[research seminar](http://www.research.mbs.ac.uk/decision-science/newsandevents)** at the University. Seminar on what you ask? Deep RL of course. During the seminar, it was also nice to see a few familiar faces from the [Machine Learning and Optimisation](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/mlo/) and the [Advanced Processor Technologies](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) groups from Computer Science, and from the Business School's [Decision and Cognitive Science Research Centre](http://www.research.mbs.ac.uk/decision-science/).

## Bath and Bristol
Caught up with an old friend in Bath. Also visited Bristol, which I have some good memories of from a decade ago. This time around, it was to meet up with the nice people at [Graphcore](https://www.graphcore.ai/).

Not a pub crawl after all. But, if the name of my band were *RL Itching to Go Wild*, this could then be seen as a UK tour. But there is no band.
