Just like [last year](https://www.ntnu.edu/web/ailab/dl_tutorial), I had the pleasure (indeed a privilege) of delivering another lecture on the current state of deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) on Nov 15, 2018, at NTNU, Trondheim. The field is moving very fast, so I get to talk about something new every time, which is fun.

The lecture was open to the public and streamed live. It was mostly attended by students taking courses offered by [Prof. Keith Downing](https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/keithd). It was also wonderful to see some of my immediate colleagues from Telenor Research and academic friends from NTNU. Some of the material I covered will likely be stale by the time you reach here. Nevertheless, below is the recording.

The lecture attempts to draw a broad and intuitive picture of the field as it stands. The historical development of the field is examined, building up to current frontiers.

One aim of this lecture is to spread awareness of current advances and some of the key technical challenges towards scaling deep RL methods to real world control/sequential decision making problems. It also aims at inspiring curiosity to tackle these challenges amongst students at University, data scientists, and academic and industry researchers intending to work in the field. A lot is going on to address each one of these challenges. Lecture favours covering enough conceptual ground to being exhaustive.

As is perhaps obvious, exposing fresh minds to technical challenges is one way to make some of them curious about advancing the field. When these minds get to work, the field invariably matures, so does its applicability. It has indeed been a great pleasure for me to also get to work with some of these minds in the recent past, and I hope to keep learning from them in the foreseeable future!

A shout out to [BRAIN NTNU](https://www.brainntnu.no/) for taking care of the local arrangements.
