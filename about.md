<img style="float: right; height: 130px; padding-left: 15px;" src="../images/ac.jpg">I am a computer scientist with a background in machine learning, computational intelligence, self-organising multi-agent systems, and the overlapping domain of natural computation. Most of my published research can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=Ldg5lbkAAAAJ&hl=en).


### Academic

After a Computer Science and Engineering degree in India, I moved to the UK, where I received a Masters in [Natural Computation](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/natural-computation/), and a [PhD in Computer Science](http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/2867/), both from the [School of Computer Science, The University of Birmingham](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Xin Yao](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~xin/). My PhD was part of a larger EPSRC project called [Market Based Control of Complex Computational Systems](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/research/projects/307).

I have further worked as a researcher (research associate/post-doc) on the following projects in the past:
* [Adaptive Dynamic Ensemble Prediction Techniques](http://people.cs.bris.ac.uk/~kovacs/adept//) at [The University of Manchester](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/)
* [Engineering Proprioception in Computing Systems](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/95042/factsheet/en) at the [University of Oslo](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/forskning/grupper/robin/) 

### Entrepreneur

My *academic run* was followed by an exciting stint at [Studix](https://www.studix.com/), a startup/team building technology to tackle systemic problems with education that inhibit learning and teaching. Driving the AI effort at Studix was my main task.

### Cigar crunching industrialist

The researcher in me drove me *half way back* to doing AI research at [Telenor Research](https://www.telenor.com/innovation/research/), where I worked as a Senior Research Scientist, with a responsibility of both applying and advancing AI methods. Some of my activities involved working with academic colleagues and students via the [Norwegian Open AI Lab](https://www.ntnu.edu/web/ailab/). On occassion, I did guest lectures on AI topics, specifically **reinforcement learning**. I also advised a handful of startups based in [Oslo Science Park](https://www.forskningsparken.no/om-oss/about-oslo-science-park/).

I am now at [Graphcore](https://www.graphcore.ai). 

Activities with the [Norwegian Open AI Lab](https://www.ntnu.edu/web/ailab/) and the startup community continue.
