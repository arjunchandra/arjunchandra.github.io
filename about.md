I am a computer scientist with a background in machine learning, computational intelligence, self-organising multi-agent systems, and the overlapping domain of natural computation.

I currently conduct fundamental and applied research within these areas at Telenor Research and the Telenor-NTNU AI Lab. In addition, I teach and advise students at NTNU, UiT, and UiO. I can also be found advising very early stage startups, the majority of which are based in Oslo Science Park.

I previously held academic research positions at the Universities of Birmingham, Manchester and Oslo. This was followed by an R&D (etc.) stint at Studix, a startup at the time, helping build technology to tackle systemic problems with education that inhibit learning and teaching.
