I am a computer scientist with a background in machine learning and computational intelligence. After a Computer Science and Engineering degree in India, I moved to the UK, where I received a Masters in [Natural Computation](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/natural-computation/), and a [PhD in Computer Science](http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/2867/) both from the [School of Computer Science, The University of Birmingham](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Xin Yao](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~xin/). My PhD was part of a larger EPSRC project called [Market Based Control of Complex Computational Systems](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/research/projects/307).

I have further worked as a researcher (research associate/post-doc) on the following projects:
* [Adaptive Dynamic Ensemble Prediction Techniques](http://people.cs.bris.ac.uk/~kovacs/adept//) at [The University of Manchester](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/)
* [Engineering Proprioception in Computing Systems](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/95042/factsheet/en) at the [University of Oslo](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/forskning/grupper/robin/) 

This was followed by an exciting stint at [Studix](https://www.studix.com/), a startup/team building technology to tackle systemic problems with education that inhibit learning and teaching. Driving the AI effort at Studix was my main task.

The AI researcher in me drove me to [Telenor Research](https://www.telenor.com/innovation/research/), where I now work as a Senior Research Scientist, with a responsibility of both applying and advancing AI methods, former to empower Telenor, and the latter to futher empower society. Some of my activities involve working with academic colleagues and students at the [Norwegian Open AI Lab](https://www.ntnu.edu/web/ailab/). On occassion, I do guest lectures on AI topics, specifically *reinforcement learning*, which is the focus of most of my current research.

Additionally, I advise a handful of startups based in [Oslo Science Park](https://www.forskningsparken.no/om-oss/about-oslo-science-park/).
