My name is Arjun Chandra. I am a computer scientist with a background in machine learning and computational intelligence. I work as a Senior Research Scientist at [Telenor Research](https://www.telenor.com/innovation/research/), some 
of which involves working with students and colleagues at the [Norwegian Open AI Lab](https://www.ntnu.edu/web/ailab/). Additionally, I advise a handful of startups based in [Oslo Science Park](https://www.forskningsparken.no/om-oss/about-oslo-science-park/). On occassion, I do guest lectures on AI topics, specifically reinforcement learning, where most of my current research is focussed.
